# Advanced-Programming
A Repository for Programming Exercises and Assignments in Advanced Programming 
The Author name reads John MUchakwe which is not correct it should instead be Fredrick Mbai. I had to use a classmates(john muchakwe) laptop to do the work since mine was broken tho i still dont get why thats the name it provides. i have tried using his code (git filter-repo --commit-callback '
if commit.committer_name == "John Muchakwe":
    commit.committer_name = "Fredmbai"
    commit.committer_email = "fredydyfre97@gmail.com"
    commit.author_name = "Fredmbai"
    commit.author_email = "fredydyfre97@gmail.com"
') but i dont see changes
